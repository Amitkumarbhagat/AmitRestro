I developed this project as my final year (8th semester) project. The project is entirely built using the C# language.
The front end is implemented in ASPX using C#, while the backend is powered by the ASP.NET framework,
also based on C#. For database management, I utilized Microsoft SQL Server. In the realm of cloud computing, 
Microsoft Azure is employed.In the future, I plan to create an administrative panel using Angular for the frontend.
The project encompasses both client and admin interfaces. The admin panel allows dynamic addition or removal of users, 
as well as the ability to cancel, reject, approve, or accept orders. 
Admins can also add food items and manage restaurant details. The authentication/login process is implemented via OTP.

we had implemented three different database the first database is something like
